# Prepare Combined Allure Results
# Usage: ./scripts/ci/prepare-combined-allure-results.sh [source-dir] [target-dir]
#
# Arguments:
#   source-dir  - Directory containing all test results (default: all-test-results)
#   target-dir  - Directory where combined Allure results will be stored (default: allure-results-combined)
#
# This script:
# 1. Merges Allure results from all environments
# 2. Verifies merged results
# 3. Converts framework results (Cypress, Playwright, Robot, Vibium, Artillery) to Allure format
# 4. Adds environment labels to prevent deduplication
# 5. Preserves history from previous reports
# 6. Creates executor.json and categories.json files
