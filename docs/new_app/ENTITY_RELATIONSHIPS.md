## 🔍 Query Examples

### Get Complete Application with All Relationships

```sql
SELECT 
    a.id,
    a.status,
    a.position,
    c.name AS company_name,
    cl.name AS client_name,
    GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT con.name) AS contacts,
    COUNT(DISTINCT n.id) AS note_count
FROM application a
LEFT JOIN company c ON a.company_id = c.id
LEFT JOIN client cl ON a.client_id = cl.id
LEFT JOIN contact con ON con.application_id = a.id
LEFT JOIN note n ON n.application_id = a.id
WHERE a.is_deleted = 0
GROUP BY a.id;
```

### Get Contact with All Emails and Phones

```sql
SELECT 
    c.id,
    c.name,
    c.title,
    ce.email,
    ce.email_type,
    ce.is_primary AS email_primary,
    cp.phone,
    cp.phone_type,
    cp.is_primary AS phone_primary
FROM contact c
LEFT JOIN contact_email ce ON ce.contact_id = c.id AND ce.is_deleted = 0
LEFT JOIN contact_phone cp ON cp.contact_id = c.id AND cp.is_deleted = 0
WHERE c.id = 1
AND c.is_deleted = 0;
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Soft Deletes**: Always filter by `is_deleted = 0` in queries
2. **Cascade Deletes**: Only `note`, `contact_email`, and `contact_phone` cascade
3. **Optional Relationships**: Most relationships are optional (NULL allowed)
4. **Multiple Relationships**: Contacts can be linked to company, application, and client simultaneously
5. **Primary Flags**: Use `is_primary` to identify preferred email/phone for contacts
