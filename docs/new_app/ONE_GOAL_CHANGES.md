# Now I'd like to addressa few items and make some changes to the following:

## Pages

### All
- All pages should include a status bar at the bottom of the page.
- All pages should include a filter at the top that's specific to the items in the table on that page excecpt for the Home page with the exception of the Job Search Sites page.

### Home Page
- Remove the Create Your First Application button.
- Change the Title/Heding to Job Search Application and center it.
- Remove the Job Search Application home-subtitle.
- Change New Application button to Add Application.

### Applications
- Remove the Create Your First Application button.
- Change New Application button to Add.

### Companies
- Remove the Create Your First Company button.
- Change New Company button to Add.

### Contacts
- Remove the Create Your First Contact button.
- Change New Contact button to Add.

### Clients
- Remove the Create Your First Client button.
- Change New Client button to Add.

### Notes
- Remove the Create Your First Application button.
- Since we're adding filters to all the Pages we can remove the Filter by Application ID label and input.

### Job Search Sites
- Remove the View Applications button.
- Change New Job Search Site button to Add.

## Panels

### Navigation
- Change the heading from ONE GOAL to Navigation.

## Tests
- Re-enable all the tests in the pipeline with the expception of the following tests:
  - Cypress
  - Playwright
  - Robot
  - Selenide

## Stable Demo QA web-site for testing (THIS SITE HAS ADS THAT CAUSE TOO MANY ISSUES).
I'd like to get the disabled tests running again and I've found a web-site that we can use.  I'd like to remove what we curently have for all the all the folling tests and add one test that tests the https://demoqa.com/automation-practice-form page.  All the tests should perform the exact same test.
