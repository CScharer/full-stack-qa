## 📊 Current Status

### Issue Summary
**Status**: ⚠️ Partially Addressed

**Problem**: Cannot filter/group tests by environment in the Allure report UI

**Current State**:
- ✅ FE tests show environment in test name/parameters
- ⚠️ BE tests may show "COMBINED" if environment can't be determined
- ⚠️ Allure Report doesn't natively support filtering by custom labels like "environment"

**Workaround**: Environment is added to test name (e.g., "Test Name [DEV]") and as a parameter for visibility

**Impact**: 
- FE tests will show environment clearly
- BE tests may need additional work to properly differentiate environments

### Completed Fixes
- ✅ Fixed IndexError in environment labeling script
- ✅ Fixed environment detection (all tests incorrectly labeled as "test")
- ✅ Fixed marker file processing (JSON parsing errors)
- ✅ Fixed BE results conversion (performance tests not appearing)
- ✅ Fixed Multi.Environment flag (showing false when tests ran in multiple environments)
- ✅ Fixed BE test failure counts (incorrect column indices in CSV parsing)

---

## 🎯 Goals

1. **Improve Environment Differentiation**
   - Ensure all tests (FE and BE) clearly show their environment
   - Make environment information easily filterable/searchable in Allure reports

2. **Enhance Allure Report Usability**
   - Improve ability to group/filter tests by environment
   - Ensure environment information is consistent across all test types

3. **Document Solution**
   - Document the approach taken
   - Update relevant documentation

## 🔧 Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Add Executor Information
**Status**: ✅ **Completed**  
**Priority**: 🔴 High

**Description**: Create `executor.json` file to populate Executors section in Allure reports with CI/CD information

**Files Created/Modified**:
- ✅ Created `scripts/ci/create-allure-executor.sh`
- ✅ Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (line 1013-1015: calls script before report generation)

**Implementation Details**:
- Script creates `executor.json` with GitHub Actions build information
- Includes build name, build order (run number), build URL, and repository URL
- Automatically detects GitHub Actions environment variables

**Testing**:
- ⏳ Verify Executors section appears in generated report (pending next CI run)
- ⏳ Verify build information is correct (pending next CI run)

---

### Step 2: Add Categories Configuration
**Status**: ✅ **Completed**  
**Priority**: 🔴 High

**Description**: Create `categories.json` file to define custom test categories

**Files Created/Modified**:
- ✅ Created `scripts/ci/create-allure-categories.sh`
- ✅ Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (line 1017-1019: calls script before report generation)

**Implementation Details**:
- Script creates `categories.json` with 4 categories:
  - Product Defects (failed tests)
  - Test Defects (broken tests)
  - Skipped Tests
  - Passed Tests

**Testing**:
- ⏳ Verify Categories section appears in generated report (pending next CI run)
- ⏳ Verify tests are properly categorized (pending next CI run)

---

### Step 3: Preserve History for Trends
**Status**: ✅ **Completed**  
**Priority**: 🔴 High

**Description**: Implement history preservation between report generations to enable Trend section

**Files Created/Modified**:
- ✅ Created `scripts/ci/preserve-allure-history.sh`
- ✅ Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
  - Line 1009-1011: Preserves history before report generation
  - Line 1047-1052: Preserves history after report generation (copies from report back to results)

**Implementation Details**:
- Script checks for existing history in previous report
- Copies history to results directory before report generation
- After report generation, copies history back to results for next run
- Uses `--clean` flag but manually preserves history folder

**Testing**:
- ⏳ Verify Trend section appears after second report generation (pending next CI run)
- ⏳ Verify historical data is preserved correctly (pending next CI run)

---

### Step 4: Integrate Missing Test Frameworks
**Status**: ✅ **Completed**  
**Priority**: 🟡 Medium

**Description**: Create conversion scripts to convert Cypress, Playwright, Robot Framework, and Vibium test results to Allure format

**Files Created/Modified**:
- ✅ Created `scripts/ci/convert-cypress-to-allure.sh`
- ✅ Created `scripts/ci/convert-playwright-to-allure.sh`
- ✅ Created `scripts/ci/convert-robot-to-allure.sh`
- ✅ Created `scripts/ci/convert-vibium-to-allure.sh`
- ✅ Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
  - Lines 990-1007: Download framework result artifacts
  - Lines 1010-1055: Convert framework results to Allure format before merging

**Implementation Details**:
- **Cypress**: Parses `mochawesome.json` or `cypress-results.json` files
  - ✅ Creates individual Allure results for each test (not summary)
  - Recursively searches for test objects in Cypress JSON structure
  - Maps Cypress states (passed/failed/pending) to Allure statuses
- **Playwright**: Parses `results.json` files from test-results directory
  - ✅ Creates individual Allure results for each test
- **Robot Framework**: Parses `output.xml` files
  - ✅ Creates individual Allure results for each test from `<test>` elements
  - Extracts test name, status, and duration from XML
- **Vibium**: Parses Vitest JSON result files from test-results directory
  - ✅ Creates individual Allure results from `assertionResults` array
  - ✅ Fixed status logic to properly detect passed tests (was showing skipped incorrectly)
  - Maps Vitest statuses (passed/failed/skipped) to Allure statuses
- All scripts create Allure JSON results with proper Epic/Feature/Story labels
- Environment labels are added automatically
- Scripts use Python for reliable JSON/XML parsing

**Testing**:
- ✅ Verified all framework tests appear in combined report
- ✅ Verified tests appear in "Features By Stories" section
- ✅ Verified Epic/Feature/Story labels are properly assigned
- ✅ Verified individual test results (not summaries) for all frameworks

---

### Step 5: Verify Selenide Results
**Status**: ✅ **Completed**  
**Priority**: 🟡 Medium

**Description**: Verify Selenide tests are generating Allure results and appearing in combined report

**Files Reviewed**:
- ✅ Reviewed `.github/workflows/env-fe.yml` (selenide-tests job, line 913-1012)
- ✅ Verified Selenide test results are uploaded with Allure results (line 1009-1010: uploads `target/allure-results/`)

**Findings**:
- Selenide uses TestNG with Allure listener (generates Allure results automatically)
- Results are uploaded as `selenide-results-{env}` artifact containing `target/allure-results/`
- Results are merged by `merge-allure-results.sh` script
- **Issue Found**: Selenide tests had generic suite label "Surefire test" which made them hard to find in Suites view

**Solution Implemented**:
- ✅ Updated `scripts/ci/add-environment-labels.sh` to detect Selenide tests
- ✅ Selenide tests identified by: `epic="HomePage Tests"` and `testClass` containing `"HomePageTests"`
- ✅ Suite label automatically changed from "Surefire test" to "Selenide Tests"
- ✅ Tests now appear in both Suites view and Features By Stories view

**Testing**:
- ✅ Verified Selenide tests appear in combined report
- ✅ Verified Selenide tests have proper suite labels ("Selenide Tests")
- ✅ Verified tests visible in Suites view under "Selenide Tests"
- ✅ Verified tests visible in Features By Stories under "HomePage Tests" → "HomePage Navigation"

## 📝 User Comments Section

- Since allure doesn't allow filtering and I do see the different items with the environment prefix I think we can consider that issue fixed
- What I don't se and I'd like to understand why is:
  - Trend
  - Categories
  - Executors
  - Suites
- In the Features By Stories I see what looks like everything that uses selenium grid, but I don't see any of the other framework suites/tests that I think I should

## 🔍 Analysis & Findings

### Environment Differentiation Status
**Status**: ✅ **Resolved** (per user feedback)

The environment differentiation issue is considered fixed. Tests are properly labeled with environment prefixes (e.g., "[DEV]", "[TEST]", "[PROD]") and can be identified in the report.

---

### Missing Report Sections Analysis

#### 1. **Trend Section** - Missing
**Status**: ⚠️ **Expected Behavior** (requires historical data)

**Root Cause**: 
- Allure's Trend section requires historical execution data from previous runs
- The `history` folder must be preserved between report generations
- Currently, reports are generated with `--clean` flag which removes history

**Current Implementation**:
- `allure generate allure-results-combined --clean -o allure-report-combined`
- The `--clean` flag removes the `history` folder, preventing trend tracking

**Solution**:
- Preserve `history` folder between runs
- Copy `allure-report-combined/history` to `allure-results-combined/history` after each report generation
- Remove `--clean` flag or implement history preservation logic

**Files to Modify**:
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (line 1034): Remove `--clean` or add history preservation
- Create script to preserve history between runs

---

#### 2. **Categories Section** - Missing
**Status**: ⚠️ **Not Configured**

**Root Cause**:
- Allure Categories section requires a `categories.json` file in the results directory
- This file defines custom test categories (e.g., "Product Defects", "Test Defects", "Flaky Tests")
- No categories file is currently being created

**Current Implementation**:
- No `categories.json` file is generated
- Allure uses default categories only (which may not be visible if no tests match)

**Solution**:
- Create `categories.json` file during report generation
- Define custom categories based on test status and labels
- Place file in `allure-results-combined/categories.json` before report generation

**Example categories.json**:
```json
[
  {
    "name": "Product Defects",
    "matchedStatuses": ["failed"]
  },
  {
    "name": "Test Defects",
    "matchedStatuses": ["broken"]
  },
  {
    "name": "Skipped Tests",
    "matchedStatuses": ["skipped"]
  }
]
```

**Files to Modify**:
- Create `scripts/ci/create-allure-categories.sh` script
- Update `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to call this script before report generation

---

#### 3. **Executors Section** - Missing
**Status**: ⚠️ **Not Configured**

**Root Cause**:
- Allure Executors section requires an `executor.json` file in the results directory
- This file contains information about the CI/CD system that ran the tests
- No executor file is currently being created

**Current Implementation**:
- No `executor.json` file is generated
- Executor information is not being captured

**Solution**:
- Create `executor.json` file during report generation
- Include CI/CD system information (GitHub Actions), build number, build URL, etc.

**Example executor.json**:
```json
{
  "name": "GitHub Actions",
  "type": "github",
  "url": "https://github.com/CScharer/full-stack-qa",
  "buildOrder": "${GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER}",
  "buildName": "${GITHUB_WORKFLOW}",
  "buildUrl": "${GITHUB_SERVER_URL}/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}/actions/runs/${GITHUB_RUN_ID}",
  "reportUrl": "",
  "reportName": "Allure Report"
}
```

**Files to Modify**:
- Create `scripts/ci/create-allure-executor.sh` script
- Update `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to call this script before report generation

---

#### 4. **Suites Section** - Missing or Incomplete
**Status**: ⚠️ **Partially Working**

**Root Cause**:
- Allure Suites section requires tests to have proper `suite` labels
- TestNG tests (Selenium Grid) have suite labels from TestNG suite files
- Other frameworks (Cypress, Playwright, Robot, Selenide, Vibium) may not be generating Allure results with suite labels

**Current Implementation**:
- TestNG tests: ✅ Have suite labels (from `testng-*-suite.xml` files)
- Cypress tests: ❌ Not generating Allure results
- Playwright tests: ❌ Not generating Allure results
- Robot Framework tests: ❌ Not generating Allure results
- Selenide tests: ✅ May have suite labels (uses TestNG)
- Vibium tests: ❌ Not generating Allure results

**Solution**:
- Ensure all test frameworks generate Allure results with proper suite labels
- Integrate Allure reporting into Cypress, Playwright, Robot Framework, and Vibium tests
- Or convert their results to Allure format (similar to BE performance tests)

**Files to Review**:
- `.github/workflows/env-fe.yml`: Check if Cypress/Playwright/Robot/Vibium generate Allure results
- Framework-specific configuration files

---

### Missing Test Frameworks in "Features By Stories"

**Status**: ⚠️ **Expected Behavior** (frameworks not integrated with Allure)

**Root Cause**:
- Only TestNG tests (Selenium Grid) have Allure annotations (`@Epic`, `@Feature`, `@Story`)
- Other frameworks are NOT generating Allure results:
  - **Cypress**: No Allure integration found
  - **Playwright**: No Allure integration found
  - **Robot Framework**: No Allure integration found
  - **Selenide**: Uses TestNG, should have Allure results (may need verification)
  - **Vibium**: No Allure integration found

**Current Implementation**:
- TestNG tests: ✅ Generate Allure JSON results with Epic/Feature/Story annotations
- Cypress tests: ❌ Results uploaded as `cypress-results-{env}` artifact (not Allure format)
- Playwright tests: ❌ Results uploaded as `playwright-results-{env}` artifact (not Allure format)
- Robot Framework tests: ❌ Results uploaded as `robot-results-{env}` artifact (not Allure format)
- Selenide tests: ✅ Should generate Allure results (uses TestNG with Allure listener)
- Vibium tests: ❌ Results uploaded as `vibium-results-{env}` artifact (not Allure format)

**Evidence**:
- `.github/workflows/env-fe.yml` shows:
  - Cypress: Uploads `cypress-results-{env}` (line ~700)
  - Playwright: Uploads `playwright-results-{env}` (line ~800)
  - Robot: Uploads `robot-results-{env}` (line ~910)
  - Vibium: Uploads `vibium-results-{env}` (line ~1085)
- Only TestNG-based tests (smoke, grid, mobile, responsive, selenide) upload `target/allure-results/`

**Solution Options**:

**Option 1: Integrate Allure into Each Framework** (Recommended for long-term)
- Add Allure adapters for Cypress, Playwright, Robot Framework, Vibium
- Configure frameworks to generate Allure JSON results
- Update CI/CD to merge these results into combined report

**Option 2: Convert Results to Allure Format** (Faster implementation)
- Create conversion scripts (similar to `convert-performance-to-allure.sh`)
- Convert Cypress/Playwright/Robot/Vibium results to Allure JSON format
- Include Epic/Feature/Story labels based on test structure

**Option 3: Hybrid Approach**
- Integrate Allure where easy (Playwright has Allure plugin)
- Convert results for frameworks without good Allure support (Robot Framework)

**Files to Modify**:
- Create conversion scripts for each framework
- Update `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to include converted results in merge
- Or integrate Allure adapters into framework configurations
