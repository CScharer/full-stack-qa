# ⚠️ CRITICAL: Protected Test Code Directory

**🚨 DO NOT MODIFY WITHOUT EXPLICIT APPROVAL 🚨**

---

## 🔒 Protection Status

This directory (`src/test/java/`) contains **protected legacy test code** that requires **special handling**.

---

## 📋 Important Information

### Current State
- **Contains**: Legacy test code that has been updated over time
- **Usage Status**: **Most code is NOT currently used** in active test execution
- **Purpose**: Preserved for potential future incorporation into test suites
- **Value**: Historical code that may be valuable for future test development

### ⚠️ Critical Rules

**🚨 MANDATORY - NEVER SKIP THESE STEPS:**

1. **✅ VERIFICATION REQUIRED - TWICE**
   - ❌ **NEVER** modify, delete, or refactor code in this directory without explicit user approval
   - ✅ **ALWAYS** verify with the user **at least TWO times** before making any changes:
     - First verification: Before starting any work
     - Second verification: Before committing any changes
   - ✅ **ALWAYS** explain what changes you plan to make and why
   - ✅ **ALWAYS** wait for explicit approval before proceeding

2. **✅ Preservation Priority**
   - ❌ **NEVER** delete files from this directory
   - ❌ **NEVER** refactor without approval
   - ❌ **NEVER** remove "unused" code without explicit confirmation
   - ✅ **ALWAYS** preserve existing code structure
   - ✅ **ALWAYS** ask before making changes, even if code appears unused

3. **✅ Change Process**
   - Step 1: Identify what needs to change
   - Step 2: **Ask user for approval** (first verification)
   - Step 3: Explain the changes and impact
   - Step 4: Wait for explicit approval
   - Step 5: Make changes (if approved)
   - Step 6: **Ask user for approval again** (second verification) before committing
   - Step 7: Wait for explicit approval before committing
